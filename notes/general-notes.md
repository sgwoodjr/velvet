General Notes
=============

* Should the validation module be exposed to the top level API, or
  should it be kept private for internal use?

  - If it is kept private, then the function names should be prepended
    with an underscore.

* Add a setup.py file

* Configure the GitHub repository to interface with travis for automatic
  builds and testing.

* The code should be designed to work with Python 2.7x and 3.x.

* What is the best method of properly using git tags with a PGP key?
